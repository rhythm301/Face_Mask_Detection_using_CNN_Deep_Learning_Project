# Face Mask Detection Using CNN

This project demonstrates a deep learning model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It uses the **Face Mask Detection dataset from Kaggle** and is implemented entirely in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of experimentation and learning.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📥 Automated dataset download via Kaggle API
- 📊 Data visualization and preprocessing
- 🧠 CNN model built using TensorFlow/Keras
- 🧪 Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics
- 💾 Final model saved as `.h5` for deployment or future use

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Face Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)
- Two classes:
  - `with_mask`
  - `without_mask`

The dataset is downloaded directly using the Kaggle API within the notebook.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Kaggle API Key (`kaggle.json`)

### Required Libraries

Install the required packages using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy kaggle

## 🚀 How to Run
- Download your kaggle.json key from Kaggle API settings.
- Upload it to the notebook environment.
- Run all cells in the notebook:
- 📓 Face Mask Detection Using CNN.ipynb

### The notebook:
- Downloads the dataset
- Preprocesses the images
- Builds a CNN model
- Trains and evaluates the model
- Saves the trained model to disk (mask_detector_model.h5)
